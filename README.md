# giblet-world 

Small repo to mess around and learn cmake and other technologies to come
The program will be a small simulation to model the creation, buying, using and destruction of giblets.

Potential other technologies to investigte and add:
* test harness - gtest, rspec
* linting scripts, integrated to build maybe
* ci?
* web technologies integration?
